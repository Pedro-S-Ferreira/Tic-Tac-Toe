# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple game of tic-tac-toe codded in python that runs in the terminal. It can be played with 2 people or agaisnt the computer. The computer features a basic programm that will intelligently recognise which squares have already been used and pick one that hasn't. The player can pick if they're playing as "X" or "O". It can detect wins, defeats and draws.

In this game, I've used the package random to generate pseudo-random numbers featured in the computer play option. I have also used a list to simulate the board and defined several functions that would were repeatedly, making the code smaller. The code shows my ability to adapt to code for a game that has a defined set of rules and gather user input, modifying the game as a result and generating an outcome based on their choices.
